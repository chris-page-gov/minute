# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Added `LOCAL_DEV.md` documentation for local development setup, including step-by-step instructions and requirement explanations.

### Changed

- Updated `docker-compose.yaml` to reference `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` from the shell environment, allowing secure password management via shell variables instead of hardcoding in `.env`.
